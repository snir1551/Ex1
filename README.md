# Ex1_OOP

This project is about a weighted and undirected graph that is a set of vertices and edges which connect the vertices, 
<br>
edge is actually neighbor vertex of this and this is actually neighbor of the vertex.

in this project we have three classes: EdgeInfo,NodeInfo, WGraphDS, WGraphAlgo.
<br>
for each of the classes we have interface:
- for EdgeInfo class we have edge_info interface
- for NodeInfo class we have node_info interface
- for WGraphDS class we have weighted_graph interface
- for WGraph_Algo class we have weighted_graph_algorithms interface
<br>
class EdgeData: he is edge class
<br>
class NodeInfo: he is node class
<br>
class WGraphDS: builds the graph by EdgeInfo,NodeInfo
<br>
class WGraph_Algo: this class does all the complex calculations in the graph
<br>
Examples of a weighted and undirected graph:
